🌌 Neon Dodge

Neon Dodge is a fast-paced, neon-themed survival and collection game built with pure HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.
Your mission? Glide your glowing orb through 100 increasingly chaotic levels, dodging obstacles, collecting energy orbs, and activating shields — all to prove you’ve mastered the neon arena.

🎮 Gameplay Overview

⚡ Levels 1 → 100 — obstacles get faster and multiply every level.

💠 Collect Orbs — clear each stage by grabbing all glowing orbs.

🛡 Shield Pickups — 5 spawn per level. Grants 30s of protection and respawns after 60s.

💥 Fail Condition — collide with an obstacle without an active shield.

🏆 Victory Screen — beat Level 100 for a cinematic win with confetti, fireworks, and victory music.
